						Best burgers known to man.  That's not just a slogan!  We strive to make every burger as if it was specialized for you personally.  Do burger joints feel as if they are rushing your tasty treat?  Do you feel like a number rather than a customer?  Well you're looking at the solution folks.  No one does you better.  We use 100% organic products with quality being our first inspection.  You name the burger!  Does anyone else do that for you?  Trick question; they don't! That's right, you can actually make the name for your own burger.  That way you always remember what you ordered and we will gladly prepare it just the way you like it.  Stop in, say hi, get treated right.
